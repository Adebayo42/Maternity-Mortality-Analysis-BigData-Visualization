# ðŸ“Š Exploring Factors Influencing Maternal Mortality

## Overview
This project analyzes global maternal mortality trends (2000â€“2020) using big data analytics and visualization techniques. It explores healthcare infrastructure, socioeconomic factors, adolescent birth rates, and anaemia prevalence to uncover insights into maternal health disparities across regions.

Delivered as a stakeholder-focused PowerPoint presentation, the project demonstrates business intelligence, operational analytics, and real-time data visualization skills.

---

## Objectives
- Analyze maternal mortality trends over the past decade.
- Investigate regional disparities and influencing factors.
- Explore relationships between healthcare access, economic indicators, and maternal mortality outcomes.
- Communicate findings to support evidence-based interventions.

---

## Research Questions
- How have maternal mortality ratios changed globally over time?
- How do risk factors such as healthcare access, adolescent birth rates, and anaemia correlate with maternal mortality?
- What is the impact of household and government health expenditures on maternal outcomes?

---

## Data Sources
- WHO Global Health Observatory (GHO)
- WHO Maternal Mortality Indicators

Datasets included maternal mortality ratios, adolescent birth rates, healthcare professional density, antenatal care coverage, caesarean section rates, health expenditure, and anaemia prevalence.

---

## Tools & Methods
- **Data Analysis**: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Trend Analysis
- **Visualization**: Tableau
- **Presentation**: Microsoft PowerPoint

---

## Key Insights
- Africa holds the highest maternal mortality rates; Europe the lowest.
- High adolescent birth rates and anaemia prevalence significantly increase mortality risks.
- Regions with greater healthcare workforce density and higher health expenditures have lower maternal mortality ratios.
- Antenatal care coverage is strongly correlated with improved maternal health outcomes.

---

## Conclusion
Reducing global maternal mortality requires:
- Strengthening healthcare infrastructure and workforce capacity.
- Increasing investment in maternal health services.
- Addressing adolescent pregnancy and socio-economic inequalities.
- Expanding access to antenatal care and skilled birth services.

Collaborative action between governments, healthcare organizations, and international agencies is critical for closing disparities and improving global maternal health.

---

## Limitations
- Data completeness varies across regions.
- Trends may not fully reflect recent healthcare developments.
- Findings are correlational, not causal.

---

## Project Relevance
Demonstrates business intelligence development,  real-time data integration, and strategic communication for operational decision-makingâ€”skills highly transferable to AI, data engineering, and facilities management transformation roles.
